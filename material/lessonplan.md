# Goals

- give an outline of the Clojure programming language
- grokking functions and recursion
- introduction to the processing (P5) API
- create experiments / visualisations involving
	- basic graphics primitives
	- loops and recursion
	- Animation
	- Noise
	- Interactivity (Mouse movement)

# day 1

## Introductions

Getting to know each other:
- Who am I, what do I do for a living?
- Who are you, where have you come in contact with programming and art? Which programming languages have you heard of?

## Overview

What is this Workshop all about, what's the schedule? (basically this very document)

## Installation

We may need to set up our environment, install some necessary sofware / tooling...

Install:
- node.js
- npm
- Java
- shadow-cljs

https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html
https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_standalone_via_code_npm_code

## Clojure Primer

### A quick Introduction to Clojure types and datastructures:

- Numbers and Strings
- Keywords and Symbols
- Vectors
- Hashmaps
- Lists
- Functions

maybe:
Immutability and the role of the Atom

## a simple programming exercise

Check out the p5js reference

    https://p5js.org/reference/

use functions render some graphics primitives on screen

e.g. play with / draw inspiration from
https://github.com/kolja/GenerativeArt/blob/main/src/landscape.cljs

# day 2

- Loops and Recursion
	- recursively change color / size / shape of objects
- Animation
	- changing color / shape / opacity over time

# day 3

- Noise and randomness
- interactivity (involving the mouse position)

# day 4
## actually: starting on day 3

- No new content is introduced on day 4
- participants develop ideas on their own and implement them.
	- this could involve material covered earlier **or**
	- research / inspiration from the P5 Examples or from reading the P5 API (https://p5js.org/examples/ https://p5js.org/reference/)

## exhibition
- Final recap and review of everybody's work
- potentially participants iterate on their own work, incorporating feedback and ideas from their fellow generative artists.
- Everybody documents their work with screenshots / screencaptures
