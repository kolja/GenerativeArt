# What is Recursion?

You are living in the topmost floor of a skyscraper with 1000 floors.

There is no elevator. Only stairs.

Every day you have to bring down the trash. When you take off in the morning,
you arrive back in you flat just in time for the evening news.

This is no life!

There is a friendly couple living just below you.
One day you meet them in the corridor.
"Hello Mr. and Mrs. Penrose, would you be so kind to take out the trash for me today?"
You ask with an innocent smile.
"Oh dear, no! We'd love to help out, but you can not possibly ask us to walk 999 flights of stairs.
We could take your trash down one floor, but this wouldn't help you, would it?"

As you trudge up the stairs that day, you are in a thoughtful mood.
All your neighbors are so kind! They'd all be willing to help you with your trash,
but the herculean task would just be to much to ask of any one single neighbour...

Back in your flat, taking a shower, it suddenly hits you:

You sit down, grab a pencil and paper and jot down the following note:

"Dear Neighbour!
please consider to deliver this trash (see attachment) to your the esteemed tenant
who lives just one floor below. I appreciate your help,
your Neighbour from floor 1000."

You attach that letter to the bag of trash, place it on the Penrose's doormat, ring
the bell and hide behind a column.
Sure enough, you see how Mr. Penrose discovers your trash, reads the attached message
and promply delivers it to your downstairs neighbor.

That day, and the following days, you can really take a breather!
Finally you get some chores done that you had postponed for ages -- and you don't even
fall asleep half way through the evening news.

Life is good!

At least for a few weeks:

One day, in late September you receive a letter:

"Dear Tenant.
It has come to our attention that you are stockpiling trash in the basement!
We have received multiple complaints from other tenants who can not access their
storage cubicles anymore.
This is Unacceptable!
Remove your trash from the basement or we will terminate your contract!
Sincerely, the landlord."

Of course. It was too good to be true.
You are in bad spirits when on your way back to your flat after cleaning up the basement until deep
into the night.

But early the next day, you are on top of the world again:

You had an idea for another letter:

"Dear Neighbour!
Please allow me to ask: Do you live on the ground floor, by chance? If so, please
do me a favour and take out the trash that was sent along with this letter.
Otherwise: Would you be so kind to pass the trash onto the tenant below?
Your grateful Neighbour from the 1000th floor."

After your trash-delivery that day, you spend all day on the balcony, observing the
entrance below. And lo and behold: around noon, the door opens, and your neighbour,
carrying your trash, appears and takes it to the dumpster in the yard.

You know that this was a valuable life lesson: Never again will you forget to
supply an appropriate termination condition, when asking your neighbour for a favour.
